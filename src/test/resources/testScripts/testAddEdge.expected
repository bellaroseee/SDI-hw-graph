# Test that Edges can be added to the graph

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add 2 pair of nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added node n3 to graph1

# Add 2 edges
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e2 from n1 to n3 in graph1

# Create another graph
created graph graph2

# Add 1 pair of nodes
added node n1 to graph2
added node n2 to graph2

# Add 1 edge
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph2

# Add 1 node
added node n3 to graph2

# Add another edge
added edge e2 from n1 to n3 in graph2
