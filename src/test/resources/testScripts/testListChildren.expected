# Test Printing outgoing edges from a node

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add 2 pair of nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added node n3 to graph1

# Add 2 edges
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e2 from n1 to n3 in graph1

# Print the outgoing edges from n1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(e1) n3(e2)

# Add another 2 pair of nodes
added node n4 to graph1
added node n5 to graph1
added node n6 to graph1

# Add another 2 edges
added edge e3 from n4 to n5 in graph1
added edge e4 from n4 to n6 in graph1

# Print the outgoing edges from n1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(e1) n3(e2)
the children of n4 in graph1 are: n5(e3) n6(e4)
